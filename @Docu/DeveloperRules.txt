Hello,

if you want to participate in the development of the idom2 project,
you are wellcome.

However, I want to ask you, to keep the following rules:

1. don't commit any changes to libxmldom.pas, that break any of 
   the XPTests, that worked before.

If you want to make major design changes, ask me before doing so,
than we can decide how we cope with it, e.g. by creating a
new branch.

If you think, there are XPTests, that are wrong (not DOM2
compliant), notify this on the mailing list or add an XPTest
to the appropriate unit, that is correct.

2. ask on the mailing list, before adding new files or directories
   to the cvs. 

Often it is important, to choose a good file name, and every 
devoloper has different opinions, what a good file name is,
so this should be discussed in advance.

3. Don't make any changes to idom2.pas.
This is the central unit, so any changes can heavily influence
the work of other people.

If you have suggestions to improve this unit, post them on 
the mailing list, if the majority of the devolopers agree
to the changes, I will add them.

If you want to add new interfaces to idom2_ext.pas, that's ok.

That's all for now, too many rules aren't good, anyway.

Uwe Fechner
