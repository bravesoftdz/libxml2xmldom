idom2-beta-1 release notes:
---------------------------

This is the first public release on sourceforge.

It contains:

a) the idom2.pas file with the dom2 interface declarations.

They were translated from java and checked against the idl definitions.

Additionally this file contains interfaces to get a dom implementation
and a simple interface to read xml files.

An interface, to get an enumeration of the installed domvendors
is included, too.

b) the idom2_ext.pas file:

Extensions to the dom2 interface definitions.

In the moment, interfaces for msxml compatibility, xpath, xslt
and some more special features are included.

c) libxmldom.pas, an implementation of these interfaces, based
   on libxml2 (www.xmlsoft.org)

d) msxml_impl.pas, an implementation based on msxml

e) XPTestSuiteIdom2.dpr, a test project with more than 375 unit tests, that
   tests most of the defined methods and interfaces.
   The tests themselves can be used as examples, how to use the dom functions,
   too.

f) The currently neccessary dll files and .so files are included, too,
   although it is better, you get them directly from the sources given
   on www.xmlsoft.org

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

idom2-pas is tested with delphi6, kylix2 (open edition) and delphi5.

It is tested on win2k and linux (debian-woody), please report it, if it runs
on other operating systems, too.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Final remarks:

- the libxmldom.pas implemention passes all 375 XPTests
- msxml_impl passes about 2/3 of these tests

- all dom2 core and xml interfaces and methods are implemented
- a good xpath implementation is included
- a simple xslt implementation is included

- the speed of libxmldom.pas is good, AND it is a crossplatform library 
  AND open source (yes, it's a feature)

Known limitations of libxmldom.pas:

a) namespace declaration attributes do not appear in the list of attributes
   of an element

b) the widestring interface in IDomPersist.xml has problems with utf16 
   character encoding (write utf8 instead)

c) the IDomNodeExt.xml property doesn't create namespace declaration
   attributes, that are defined above the node, from which we ask the
   xml string

d) there is no IDomParseError interface yet, so if there was an error, we
   don't know, in which line.

   Workaround:
   Use a console application, there you get the precise error message on the
   screen. (On Kylix you get them on the console, you started kylix or the
   X11 application from).

e) the prettyPrint option just inserts line breaks, no indenting spaces

f) all linebreaks in the output are unix-style (#10)

g) On Kylix you get the error message 'Validation failure. No DTD found.'
   each time you parse a file without DTD, even if you set validate to false.
   This message appears on the console only, you can safely ignore it.

So there is still some work to be done, you are invited to help.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
We would be pleased, if other people could adapt more dom implementations,
e.g. OpenXML or Xerces or Sablotron for using the idom2.pas interfaces.

Also the integration of the SAX interface and an implementation of it,
using libxml2, would be nice.
